# Arduino-Project
📌 Project Overview

This project is an autonomous robot designed using Arduino Uno, capable of detecting and avoiding obstacles in real time while integrating GPS tracking and crash detection for enhanced navigation and safety. The system utilizes ultrasonic sensors, servo motors, and GPS modules to make intelligent movement decisions.

🚀 Features

Obstacle Avoidance – Uses ultrasonic sensors to detect and navigate around obstacles.

Crash Detection – Identifies potential collisions and alters movement accordingly.

GPS Tracking – Sends real-time location updates for enhanced tracking.

PID Control – Optimized motor movement for smoother navigation.

Serial Communication – Logs data for debugging and performance analysis.
